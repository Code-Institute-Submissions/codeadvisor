# Code Advisor 

Code advisor is the third milestone I have designed and developed at Code Institue. It is a platform where students can showcase thier projects by sharing their Github repositories. The codes will be reviewed by fellow students and each reviews will receive either a like or a dislike.

The goal of this project is to provide new coders a platform where they can gain more confidence developing projects by seeing what they need to work on.
